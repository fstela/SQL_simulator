# SQL Database Simulator
> A C++ program which claims the principles of object-oriented programming.

  This project simulates a SQL database by either receiving commands from the console, or from a file passed as an argument to the program. The commands are `case-sensitive`, and while all the keywords are written in uppercase, the name of the tables and columns will be written in lowercase.
