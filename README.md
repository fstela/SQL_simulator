# SQL Database Simulator
> A C++ program which claims the principles of object-oriented programming.

  This project simulates a SQL database by either receiving commands from the console, or from a file passed as an argument to the program. The commands are `case-sensitive`, and while all the keywords are written in uppercase, the name of the tables and columns will be written in lowercase. The input types have been narrowed down to `integer, float, text`.
  
  
 ### Examples

1. CREATE TABLE students ((id, integer, 1000, 0), (nume, text, 128, ’’), (grupa, text,50,’1000’))
